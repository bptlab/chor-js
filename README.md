## Features

- model complex choreography diagrams
- create and reuse roles on the fly
- intuitively manage participant bands
- show, hide and swap messages
- import/export standard-compliant BPMN2 XML

chor-js supports most of the elements in the choreography diagram standard. For an up-to-date overview, see [our wiki](https://github.com/jan-ladleif/chor-js/wiki/Element-Support).

## Installation & Usage

chor-js is packaged [through npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chor-js). For an example, see [our demo](https://github.com/jan-ladleif/chor-js-demo). 

As the library is heavily based on [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/), a lot of the instructions and techniques described there also work for chor-js.
